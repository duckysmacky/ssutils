# SSUtils - Super Simple Utilities

### A really simple helper Java library which adds different shortcuts and missing utility
A lot of things are just simply shortcuts to existing features, but there are plans to add *actually* useful utility
in the future. Heavily inspired by the ease-of-use of Python's built-in functions.

*still very WIP*

## Features
- max(), min(), sum(), all() and any() *static* methods
- Really inefficient code
- More coming soon
